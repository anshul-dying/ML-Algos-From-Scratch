# Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch

A minimal and educational repository implementing core Machine Learning algorithms from scratch â€” **no built-in ML libraries used**.

This project is designed for learning and understanding the underlying logic, intuition, and mathematics behind machine learning models. It avoids the use of libraries like `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, or `lightgbm` for model building, and focuses on building everything from the ground up using **pure Python and NumPy**.

## Features

- Implementations of core ML algorithms from scratch
- Focus on interpretability and step-by-step logic
- Uses only Python and NumPy
- Great for beginners who want to understand *how* ML works under the hood
